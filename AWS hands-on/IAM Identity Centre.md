Setting up IDENTITY Centre user access portal
----------------------------------------------

The setup is done on top of AWS organizations. Only the management account is currently present in the Organizations account.
I have setup IAM Identity Centre to grant different level of access to users who belongs to different groups.
This setup can contain as many accounts as the AWS organizations can contain. The access can be fine grained using the permission sets and policies.

Currently I have given predefined permission sets. Custom permission sets can be given as we like.
