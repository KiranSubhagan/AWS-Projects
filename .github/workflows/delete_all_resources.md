The workflow is useful for anyone who is starting out to learn AWS services, especially EC2 and S3.
When I started out, these services incurred cost on my account. So I have created this workflow to terminate/delete all Ec2 and S3 that persists even after I have practiced with it.
This is a scheduled workflow which will run daily at 00:00 IST. It can be run manually as well.
